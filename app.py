    Section 1: Prompt for identifying strengths and weaknesses from each report

    Task:
    Summarize a psychometric or developmental report as a trusted career coach. Identify key strengths and areas of improvements in 2-3 lines each, focusing on critical insights for self-awareness and growth. Be specific, actionable, and motivational.

    Example Output:

    Strengths:
    You excel at solving problems under pressure and inspire trust with your collaborative approach.

    Growth Opportunities:
    Improve time management to reduce stress and build confidence to take bold leadership steps.

    <Input: uploaded report / data>


    Section 2: Summary section:

    Play the role of a trusted coach. You have been shared with longitudinal psychometric data (strengths and improvement areas across reports and testimonials by year). Analyse trends across the longitudinal data in terms of strengths and improvement and, provide a 2-paragraph insight covering these key areas:

    Common Strength Themes: Identify recurring strengths and what they reveal about the individualâ€™s core capabilities.
    Common Improvement Themes: Highlight consistent areas for growth and their impact.
    Contradictory Feedback or Outliers: Identify any contradictions or unique patterns across reports.
    Links Between Strengths and Improvement Areas: Examine the Relationship Between Strengths and Improvement Areas (if any improvement area is a possible side effect of a strength of that person)
    Blind Spots: Point out overlooked areas of potential concern.
    Recommended Actions: Provide short- and long-term steps to maximize strengths and address improvement areas.
